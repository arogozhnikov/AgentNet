# What is AgentNet?

No time to play games? Let machines do this for you!

AgentNet is a reinforcement learning framework, 
which is currently used to play different games (i.e. OpenAI Gym).

List of already implemented reinforcement techniques:
- Q-learning (or deep Q-learning, since we support arbitrary complexity of network)
- SARSA
- N-step Advantage Actor-Critic (A2c)
- N-step Deterministic Policy Gradient



## Installation

[Here's an installation guide](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/AgentNet/wiki/Installing-AgentNet)

### Manual install

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yandexdataschool/AgentNet.git && cd AgentNet`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install library itself: `pip install -e .`

### [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/justheuristic/agentnet/)

If you use Docker Kitematic, simply run `justheuristic/agentnet` container and click on 'web preview'.

Otherwise: 
1. install [Docker](http://docs.docker.com/installation/),
2. make sure `docker` daemon is running (`sudo service docker start`)
3. make sure no application is using port 1234 (this is the default port that can be changed)
4. `[sudo] docker run -d -p 1234:8888 justheuristic/agentnet`
5. Access via localhost:1234 or whatever port you chose
  


# Documentation and tutorials
AgentNet is using embedded documentation, so calling `help(some_function_or_object)` or pressing shift+tab in Ipython will yield description of what that thing is supposed to do.

A standard pipeline of AgentNet experiment can be found among examples
* [Playing Atari SpaceInvaders with Convolutional NN via OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/AgentNet/blob/master/examples/Playing%20Atari%20with%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20%28OpenAI%20Gym%29.ipynb)
  * Step-by-step explanation of what you need to do to recreate DeepMind Atari DQN
  * Written in a generic way, so that adding recurrent memory or changing learning algorithm could be done in a couple of lines
* [Simple Deep Recurrent Reinforcement Learning setup](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/AgentNet/blob/master/examples/Basic%20tutorial%20on%20Boolearn%20Reasoning%20problem.ipynb)
  * Most basic demo, if a bit boring. Covers the problem of learning "If X1 than Y1 Else Y2".
  * Only required if SpaceInvaders left you confused.



# Demos

##### If you wish to get acquainted with the current library state, view some of the ./examples
* [Playing Atari with Convolutional NN via OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/AgentNet/blob/master/examples/Playing%20Atari%20with%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20%28OpenAI%20Gym%29.ipynb)
  * Can switch to any visual game thanks to their awesome interface
  * Very simplistic, non-recurrent suffering from atari flickering, etc.
* [Deep Recurrent Kung-Fu training with GRUs and actor-critic](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/AgentNet/blob/master/examples/Deep%20Kung-Fu%20with%20GRUs%20and%20A2c%20algorithm%20%28OpenAI%20Gym%29.ipynb)
  * Uses the "Playing atari" example with minor changes
  * Trains via Advantage actor-critic (value+policy-based)
* [Simple Deep Recurrent Reinforcement Learning setup](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/AgentNet/blob/master/examples/Basic%20tutorial%20on%20Boolearn%20Reasoning%20problem.ipynb)
  * Trying to guess the interconnected hidden factors on a synthetic problem setup
* [Stack-augmented GRU generator](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/AgentNet/blob/master/examples/Stack%20RNN%20for%20formal%20sequence%20modelling.ipynb)
  * Reproducing http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01007 with less code
* [MOAR deep recurrent value-based LR for wikipedia facts guessing](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/AgentNet/blob/master/examples/Advanced%20MDP%20tools%20and%20wikicat.ipynb)
  * Trying to figure a policy on guessing musician attributes (genres, decades active, instruments, etc)
  * Using several hidden layers and 3-step Q-learning
* More to come
